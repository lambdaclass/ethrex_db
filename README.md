# ethrex_db

**EthrexDB** is a lightweight Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) based database, designed to serve as a foundational storage layer for Ethereum execution environments.

Most blockchains separate the world state from the proof structure, typically using a general purpose key value store alongside a Merkle Patricia Trie. This leads to redundant data storage and inefficiencies each state update can require O((logâ€¯N)Â²) disk operations due to nested log time insertions. EthrexDB solves this by tightly coupling the Merkle tree with the state storage itself. This unified approach removes duplication, reduces I/O overhead, and enables faster state transitions with native proof support.
